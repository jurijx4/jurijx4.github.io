ConsenSys Academy final project 

On- chain relationship 

I created a decentralized application that allows a certain user to create a relationship between him and his special person which will be forever saved in the blockchain. The user needs 
The user needs to enter his name, second person's name, the relationship they are in and the number of kids they have. 
User can also destroy his relationship by deleting persons name and setting his status to single.
 If the relationship is blessed with another child they can easily add the child to their relationship.

    - index.html 
    - index.js where all the magic with web3.js is made.
